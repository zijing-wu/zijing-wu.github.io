I like detective stories and I must have read Mr Holmes in primary school, but I have never read any of the works by Argatha Christina. I have no idea why. It's just as I don't know why I suddenly went to get a copy of Death on the Nile this weekend and finished it in a little more than a day.

It is a page turner. Not in the same way throughout the book, but I just couldn't put it down. It has a rather slow beginning. You know there will be death, you can judge a book by it's cover sometimes, but it doesn't appear until half way. I wasn't even sure who would be killed, Linnet, Simon, or Jackie. I still think it's a good angle if Jackie is murdered, seemingly it must be done by Linnet and / or Simon, but there is a deeper plot. Maybe the criminal has some less known relationship with Jackie; maybe the criminal wants to frame the new couple; maybe ...

As the characters were introduced and gathered on the steamer, it was getting more and more intense. It was like a horror movie that you know something bad is happening, but don't know when, where, or how. And through days of rocky but safe days on the Nile, tragedy happened. Jackie fired the gun on Simon. But, it was in the public, and shot the leg, only. Before we could recover from this accident, Linnet was found dead. And the investigation started, with more and more unveiled. I must praise the pacing of this story.

I won't go into the story that much, as I believe most of people know it too well. I'd like to share only my thoughts on this story.

What I love most is definitely author's kindness towards all characters. Everyone has his/her story, personality, sun and shadow. For example, Cornelia Robson, cousin of Miss van Schuyler, seemed to be a poor girl brought on the trip and ordered around as a maid. The sympathy grew when we found that her father went bankrupt because Linnet's father's economic speculations. But we'd gladly learned that she has such a kind heart that though she still feels sore towards Linnet because of her father, she felt sad for Linnet's death. She saw the beauty in her and wept for her lost. Even more encouraging would be her having "original mind" and choose Dr Bessner as husband, for his character and knowledge over appearrance. Cornelia is only a side character among a dozen of them, but we could see many facets of her. She is a person, not just a puppet in Jackie's plot. I think this is the so-called feminine softness in Argatha's novels, compared to other highly successful detective novels.

Because there are so many characters involved, each with his/her stories and links to Linnet, there are quite a good number of side stories, clues, suspicious points, or just extra information. The falling boulder, the telegram, the unknown serial killer, the hidding and lying of many people, just to name a few. They keep you alert and keep you wonder, what's going on here? Is this a clue related to solving the mystery? It's really enjoyable learning more and more information with the detective and trying to deduce the murderer together.

However, there's one thing I was a little disappointed. The story is great, but the deduction is just a story. There is no hard proof on it. The author must make Simon to be the soft childish boy to confess immediately, otherwise it would have been a good escape. Maybe that's the mercy towards this lovers, not having them think of this horrible trip anymore. But it is a bit weak on the revelation.

After reading the novel, I quickly watched the movie (1978). It was a good adaption, with all the necessary reduction. I like how it cut the number of characters and have Mr Poirot eavesdrop every important conversations. I really envied they shooting the movie in Egypt, really climbing onto the pyramids, reading under the shadow of the Sphinx, and walking among the colussums.

I didn't comment on Mr Poirot, as this is the first novel I read on him and I think I shall give him more time to demonstrate his full enchantment. He is very different of course, but I haven't found my words for him.
