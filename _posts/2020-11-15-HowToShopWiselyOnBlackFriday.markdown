Yes, it's the time of the year again. You are pulling on thick sweaters, asking for hot chocholate but not iced coffee, and curling up in the couch a lot longer. Maybe you are planning for some family reunion, or thinking of snow flake themed decorations, or having some quality time with yourself. You are constantly reminded that the holidays are coming and so as the shopping season.

It is a hard year for everyone and we all deserve something nice. But how to pick the right things without hurting your wallet badly? I've been looking at a number of items recently and I'm trying to optimize my decision making process. Here are a few dos and don'ts that I find helpful.

**Do know your financials, but don't set the budget**

Before you buy anything, you want to be clear how deep your pockets are. You don't want to get something that's beyond your comfort level; but buying something with very limited features simply because it's cheaper is also non-ideal. Understanding your financial situations will give you a rough idea how much you would be comfortable spending.

I think this is exactly the right amount of budgeting to do. Many people recommend to set a budget before you choose the items, but I don't think this is the right order. 

First, you don't know the products. How can I decide my budget when I don't even know what my options are? Not to mention deciding whether I should add a bit more money for an advanced feature. Even if you have a rough idea how much the item costs, it's not that you won't spend 1 dollar more for a newer/better version. If you do, that might mean that you are setting too high a budget, or it should be better called "upper bound". You usually don't want to spend all you can afford.

**Do research on the features, but don't dwell on them**

Understanding the features and specs are important. They are usually numbers and codes, which you may or may not be familiar with. Try to find a way to materialize them to make sure you know what you are getting.

However, I do find myself tempted to get everything the newest/best. Knowing what you are going to do with them help a lot. You can get a race car that runs at 250 mph, but when you are only driving it near the neighborhood, the max capacity is just a number, and you probably don't want to pay for the high maintenance fees. I'd usually leave a small buffer room for future compatibility, but supreme specs might not always be a blessing. 

**Do get when you want it, don't wait for the "new" version**

There is always a newer version coming out. There are always rumors about the new features, better performance, higher efficiency. But waiting for it is also a lost at the present. You will be thinking about it for longer, not being able to do what you want for longer, and probably you would wait for the positive reviews for the new model.

I ask myself, when do I want it. I don't desperately need it by a hard deadline, but when would I start using it? If it is hindering you from doing what you want, I'd get it sooner rather than later. There are too many uncertainties on the "upcoming" version but the difficulties are real. If the currently available ones can satisfy your needs, they are good choices.

But if you are not planning to use it soon, don't buy it because you might use it someday and it's having a big discount. Not buying gives you a 100% discount!

**Do make a wishlist, but don't make it a register**

I like to balance what I actually buy. Something I need, something I want, something useless but just looking at it makes me smile. Of course, there are many other things I like and I won't get them in the end. Don't feel that it's a lost. Not having something might be better than owning it. You enjoyed checking things out (remember the fun of window shopping?), you have better use of that portion of money, and you can name something when people ask for a gift suggestion.

I've added quite a few things into my shopping cart. I can't say I follow what I wrote exactly, but I'm getting better at this. Hope you enjoy shopping and have a great holiday ahead =))
