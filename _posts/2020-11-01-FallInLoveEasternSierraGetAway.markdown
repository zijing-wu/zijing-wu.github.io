I started falling in love of the fall season. It’s colorful, it’s trasient, it’s various, it’s unpredictable, and it’s heart warming. The foliage captures all of these beauty.

I had a short roadtrip with friends to Eastern Sierra. It was two weeks ago, but when I start thinking about the trip, all the colorful leaves just started shining right in front of me. I wanted to write down everything from the trip, every path we walked, every turn we took, every stream that touched us, every sun shine that lay on us, but I can't. I can't capture half the greatness, even with words, photos, videos, and drones. I will try to share the beauty I felt, but I'd suggest you take this as a trailer of what you'd experience when you get there.

I could have saved this to the end, but I just can't wait. Yes, my favorite of all lakes visited is the Convict Lake. Anything else loses its color compared to the convict lake, literally and metaphorically. 

The convict lake has just the right balance in all attributes that it possesses. My first impression is its color. When I first stepped out of the car, I was amazed by how brightly the golden leaves were when they danced against the deep blue lake. As I walked further in the trail, I realized that gold and blue are just the appetizers. The painting slowly rolled out and you can see that the trees are nicely layered in different shades. From pine to fern; from olive to lime; from amber to sand; from apricot to coral; from redorange to crimson; there are just too many variations of leaves. What's more amazing was how these colors were arranged. It was as if an artist set the trees and leaves deliberately to make sure the placement was perfect. There were areas that have colors transit smoothly, some have one or two leaves popping out, and even one stretch of gold leaves that curved its way up the slope.

And this guided me to appreciate the structure of the area. The lake is surrounded by tall mountains, which were too steep and too high for plants and thus showing their bare rocks. The mountains were not that abominable thanks to the thin veil the fog drew upon them. Under this grand background, the lake looked more tranquil. Calm with little waves, the lake quietly reflected the mountain and watched people fishing and rowing with a smily eyes. Only when the occasional breeth came through the leaves can you hear the lake giggled lightly.

No matter how much I love the colors of the convict lake, I must admit that the north lake gives a more "fall" feeling. Unlike the convict lake with deep blue water and evergreen trees that gives you a hint that winter is coming, the north lake is pure warmth.

The bulrush enclosed the lake with its caramel colored ears. I could only see a slice of the lake through the bulrush, which was also the same color because of the reflection. This set a solid base for the lake. Around the lake, the trees were mostly of one type. They have smaller leaves in pumpkin color and when the wind blew past, the leaves shivered like butterflies flutter their wings. The afternoon sun hugged on us and I felt it was just perfect. Of course, a cup of spiced apple cider would make it even better.

One real surprise came when we checked the photos of the drones later. It was totally different from what you see in the eyes, but it's at the default desktop background of Mac OSX High Sierra. We didn't know about this so the positions don't match exactly, but it is the place!

Mono lake is drastically different from any other lakes we saw on this trip. No leaves, no color, no trail. The most prominent things you see are the white tufa towers. They are comprised of precipitated calcium carbonate, which came from the interaction of freshwater springs and the highly alkaline lake waters. Having nothing to block the strong sunshine, the lake looked almost monochrome, with the water in black, and the ground and the tufa towers blazingly white.

Life is short and maybe that's why people are keen to chase transient beauty. Sun rise and sun set, spring blossoms and fall foliage. It's just like Fosca in All Men Are Mortal. After thousands of years, he is still awaken by mortal people for the sparkles in their beliefs and values.
