We will have the chance to talk about other things I like. Let's begin with stories.

I like stories, no, I love them. I enjoy escaping from my sometimes boring life and getting into another world. I like to imagine myself there, as an invisible observer or sometimes one of the characters. It feels like I can live another life shortly, in any space, any time, realistically or fictionally. This experience makes me feel rich and satisfied.

Natuarally, I look for stories, from movies, series, musicals, operas, and of course begging my friends to tell more. But I gradually realize my favorite is still stories in words. I understand the beauty in telling stories in a more lively way, elaborating all the details, pleasing every senses. However, this is the exact reason why I prefer text. The medium itself limits the possibility of a complete expression, which gives me more space to interpret and imagine. Of course, also a bit more room to fit myself in.

To help myself melt into different worlds more easily, I explore beyond reading. The first time I became aware of the hidden stories was when I had a bowl of noodles thousands miles away from home. The presentation, the taste, the ingredients were all new to me, but somehow it felt similar to my favorite noodles at home. I could see when people from my hometown moved years ago, they tried to materialize their feeling of nostalgia in the noodles. And the tweaks and differences capture their gradual adaptation to the local environment and culture.

After that, I understand a bit more of the stories. They can be in a bowl of noodles, the smell of an tangerine orange, a font that mom loves to use, a soft toy that travels with me around the world, a habit I developed over time, or a tea pot from a friend. Because of their obscurity, the stories might not be easy to understand and have others feel the same feeling.

I hope more people can enjoy the stories as I do, so I'd like to do two things to bridge this gap: telling stories and providing more context. 

This is the first time I tried to tell stories. My friends used to call me a story blackhole as I kept asking for stories but not telling them back. I will try to tell stories here, from my life, friends, book/movie, anything. It could be trivial but somehow hit me; it could be something big and I can only peek into one corner of it. But I will try to tell you what I see, what I hear, what I feel, and what I think of it. Pardon my immature writing, I hope to get better in the process.

The second thing is to help understand the context. It becomes easier to see where the others come from, why certain reactions are nature, and where the strong feelings originate and grow. The current world is highly divided. This is because of the conflicts in profit but also because people are often inside their own stories and not understanding each other. I will try to share what I know/learn to build up common understanding. I know there won't be many reader, but knowing that I might benefit someone makes me happy already. Moreover, it helps me comb through what & how I want to say to the world and I would deliver the message better next time.

I had, on different occassions, an urge to write something down. But either I never started, or I suddenly had too much to say and I couldn't capture it. So in the end, nothing came out. Hopefully through continuous writing, the process will be smoother.

Artists create when they are super happy or super sad. I remember hearing this from some podcast. I'm in neither situation, but I'm not an aritst anyways. I can just start typing~
