I am a lot of things: I studied business and tech and work as a software engineer; I love science and tech, but also arts and literature; I cook, I play sports, I read, and I enjoy laying on the couch binging netflix. But deep inside, I am an explorer. 

Writing is a new land I stepped my foot on. I walk around with observant eyes, smart ears, and a curious mind. And I decided to write down what interests / inspires me and share it around. I love discussion and feedback so let me know!

我有很多身份，我喜欢很多东西，有些看似矛盾但在我身上并不冲突。但我觉得探索者可能可以更好地总结我，而写东西算是我最新的一项探索。我习惯了阅读、聆听、观察，却是第一次有冲动试图记录这些让我感兴趣的事情，并且分享他们。如果有任何想要告诉我的，非常欢迎！
